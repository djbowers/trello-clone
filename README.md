# trello-clone

I built this clone of Trello while following along the YouTube series Let's Create a Trello Clone with React + Redux by 
SelfDevTV. 

I decided to implement all of the styling using SCSS modules instead doing the styling in the JavaScript files as done in the videos.

My next step for this project is to add test automation before expanding out any additional features.
